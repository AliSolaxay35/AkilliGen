Dice Rolls Utility And Loader - Summary

Purpose:
This Project Includes Two Python Scripts That Generate Dice Roll Data And Load It Efficiently For Use In Games Or Simulations.

1. dice_utils.py

Functions:
- generate_and_save_dice_rolls(filename="dice_rolls.pkl", count=10_000):
  Generates Count Pairs Of Dice Rolls (Two Numbers From 1 To 6) And Saves Them To A Binary File Using Pickle.
  If The File Already Exists, The Function Skips Generation To Avoid Overwriting.

- load_dice_rolls(filename="dice_rolls.pkl"):
  Loads The Saved Dice Roll Data From The File And Returns A Generator That Yields One Dice Roll Pair At A Time, Allowing Efficient Memory Usage.

2. Backgammon.py

Usage:
- Imports The Utility Functions From dice_utils.py And Uses Them To Generate Dice Rolls (If Not Already Generated) And Then Loads The Data.
- It Prints The First 5 Dice Rolls As A Demonstration.

Main Function:
- Calls generate_and_save_dice_rolls() To Ensure Data Is Ready.
- Iterates Through The Loaded Dice Rolls Using The Generator And Prints The First Five Rolls.

How To Run:
1. Make Sure Both Files (dice_utils.py And backgammon.py) Are In The Same Directory.
2. Run The Command In Terminal Or VSCode Terminal:
   python backgammon.py

3. The Program Will Generate Dice Rolls If Needed, Then Print The First Five Dice Roll Pairs.

Notes:
- Using A Generator In load_dice_rolls Improves Memory Efficiency By Yielding Dice Rolls One By One Instead Of Loading All At Once.
- The Saved File dice_rolls.pkl Is A Binary File Created By Pickle And Should Be Kept In The Same Folder For Loading.

Thank You.
